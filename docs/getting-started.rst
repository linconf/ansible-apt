Default configuration
---------------------

Role tries to detect the original APT repositories configured on the system and
use them in the generated :file:`/etc/apt/sources.list` configuration file. They
will be placed before the default repositories, with assumption that the
original repositories pointed to the closest mirror.

The ``non-free`` repositories will be enabled automatically on hardware-based
hosts in case any non-free firmware is required. Otherwise, only the ``main``
and ``universe`` (on Ubuntu) repositories are enabled; you can control this
using the :envvar:`apt__nonfree` variable.


Example inventory
-----------------

``debops.apt`` is included by default in the :file:`common.yml` DebOps playbook;
you don't need to do anything to have it executed.

If you donâ€™t want to let ``debops.apt`` manage APT, you can do this with the
following setting in your inventory:

.. code-block:: yaml

   apt__enabled: False


Example playbook
----------------

If you are using this role without DebOps, here's an example Ansible playbook
that uses the ``debops.apt`` role:

.. literalinclude:: playbooks/apt.yml
   :language: yaml


Ansible tags
------------

You can use Ansible ``--tags`` or ``--skip-tags`` parameters to limit what
tasks are performed during Ansible run. This can be used after a host was first
configured to speed up playbook execution, when you are sure that most of the
configuration is already in the desired state.

Available role tags:

``role::apt``
  Main role tag, should be used in the playbook to execute all of the role
  tasks as well as role dependencies.
